Hey! I am Nasreen, a Web Developer from _San Francisco_. If you are eager to know the name of that Silicon Valley company I work for, it is _coming soon.._ ( hello recruiters, this smart techie is available in the job market. )

My interests and background is as diverse as the city. A _Mechanical Engineer_ turned _Nanotechnologist_, who almost wanted to be a _Journalist_ but found joy and peace in Programming. If it was a movie, this would have been my _'happily ever after'_ moment. But let's go with _'and that's how she started her journey as a programmer...'_

I am a ```Java``` enthusiast and uses ```Spring Boot``` for web development. I code in ```[Python, SQL, R and Ruby]``` on and off. I have been picking up _Javascript_ these days. It is growing on me.

This blog is a journal of my coding journey. Things I learned, glitches I have encountered and troubleshooted, my experience with getting to know the tech community,  beginners guide to _'networking'_ and all that came along the way.

And yes! Welcome to my blog.
If my blogs could help to make your coding journey a little easier, please let me know.
