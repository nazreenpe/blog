      <description>Hey! I am Nasreen, a Web Developer from San Francisco. If you are eager to know the name of that Silicon Valley company I work for, it is coming soon.. ( hello recruiters, this smart techie is available in the job market. )
My interests and background is as diverse as the city. A Mechanical Engineer turned Nanotechnologist, who almost wanted to be a Journalist but found joy and peace in Programming.</description>
